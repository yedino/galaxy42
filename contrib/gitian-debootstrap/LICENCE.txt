Files here are possibly copied from other projects,
e.g. xenial was copied (unless changed, see git log) from Ubuntu (15.10 probably)
so you should find the file (by content) and see it's LICENCE before taking any action
that is related to that (how ever, Ubuntu as it's files like that one are generally some FOSS kind of licence).
