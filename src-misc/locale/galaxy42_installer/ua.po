"Gitian uses LXC to download source code, therefore LXC must have access to "

"LXC needs only access to the network card that you are using to connect to "
"Internet(or to a server that has all files needed to build). \n"

"(e.g. WiFi, VPN, Cjdns). \n"
"It is also possible that some of them are very important (e.g. work VPN) and "
"absolutelly you don't want to give any chance LXC to access such card.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore you have to decide (in next step)\n"
"Either allow LXC to use all and any network card, this is easy and "
"comfortable.\n"
"Or else allow LXC to access only some of card - you will manually enter list "
"of cards [eth0 eth1 wlan0...] that LXC has the right to ever user."
