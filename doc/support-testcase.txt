=====================================================================

More detailed exact test-cases and use-cases that we support.

This is quite short list, mainly for beta-testers.
Read other doc/ for explanation of some things used here.

=====================================================================
=== Bugs ===

See README.md release notes for bugs bug#J... that are mentioned here (if any).

=====================================================================
=== Build and run ===

[ ] linux: get sources from git; ./install && ./do
[ ] sudo ./tunserver.elf
[ ] + same when:  ~/other-dir ; sudo ~/sources-dir/tunserver.elf
[ ] to not run as root, add linux caps CAP_NET_ADMIN on the binary, then repeat above executions as user, not as root

[ ] macosx: get sources from git; (follow macosx readme!) ; ./do
[ ] sudo ./tunserver.elf # .mo gettext works
[ ] + same when:  ~/other-dir ; sudo ~/sources-dir/tunserver.elf

[ ] cygwin: get sources from git; (follow cygwin/mingw readme!) ; cmake && make ; (download .mo files!)
(in Cygwin console) ./tunserver.elf.exe # .mo gettext works
[ ] + same when you are in other CWD and run somedir/tunserver.elf.exe
[ ] + same with cmd.exe instead cygwin's own console

[ ] download sources on windows from git;  (follow MSVC readme!) ; cmake && make ; (download .mo files!)
[ ] ./tunserver.elf.exe  # works but (bug#J332)
[ ] + same when you are in other CWD and run somedir/tunserver.elf.exe # works but (bug#J332)
[ ] + same with cmd.exe instead cygwin's own console # works but (bug#J332)

=== Using pre-built binary ===

[ ] On windows: get the installer .exe, run it.
[ ] The program will be in file: files/galaxy42/tunserver.elf.exe
[ ] Program will be installed as service and will run on boot.
[ ] Afte reboot you can connect to ipv6 of other computer, if this computer is peering you (connects into you)
[ ] + disable the service. Run the installed .exe manually. It will work and you can specify --peer option ... as well as see own IP.

[ ] On Linux: get the .tar.gz, unpack it
[ ] sudo ./galaxy42-static-start.sh (you must run this script! do not use ./galaxy42.elf directly without proper options or it will crash e.g. with SIGBUS)
[ ] + same when:  ~/other-dir ; sudo ~/sources-dir/tunserver.elf
[ ] to not run as root, add linux caps CAP_NET_ADMIN on the binary, then repeat above executions as user, not as root

On macosx: currently not supporting this untill we resolve bug#J278
