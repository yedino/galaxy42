More detailed exact test-cases and use-cases that we support.

=== Bugs ===

See README.md release notes for bugs bug#J... that are mentioned here (if any).

=== Build and run ===

linux: get sources from git; ./install && ./do
sudo ./tunserver.elf
+ same when:  ~/other-dir ; sudo ~/sources-dir/tunserver.elf

macosx: get sources from git; (follow macosx readme!) ; ./do
sudo ./tunserver.elf # .mo gettext works
??? + same when:  ~/other-dir ; sudo ~/sources-dir/tunserver.elf

cygwin: get sources from git; (follow cygwin/mingw readme!) ; cmake && make ; (download .mo files!)
(in Cygwin console) ./tunserver.elf.exe # .mo gettext works
+ same when you are in other CWD and run somedir/tunserver.elf.exe
+ same with cmd.exe instead cygwin's own console

download sources on windows from git;  (follow MSVC readme!) ; cmake && make ; (download .mo files!)
./tunserver.elf.exe  # works but (bug#J332)
+ same when you are in other CWD and run somedir/tunserver.elf.exe # works but (bug#J332)
+ same with cmd.exe instead cygwin's own console # works but (bug#J332)


=== Using pre-built binary ===

On windows: get the installer .exe, run it.
The Program files/galaxy42/tunserver.elf.exe

Program will be installed as service and will run on boot.
+ disable the service. Run the installed .exe manually. It will work and you can specify --peer option ... as well as see own IP.

On macosx: currently not supporting this untill we resolve bug#J278
