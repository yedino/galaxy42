Here we place funcions with special behaviour, e.g.:
- that abort the program
- that on purpose cause UB (undefined behaviour in C/C++)
- causes errors
mostly for testing or demonstraction purposes, and therefore:
- should not be covered by normal unit-tests
- could require special flags or compilation
