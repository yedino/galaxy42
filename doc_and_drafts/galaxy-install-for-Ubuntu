This Readme contains information how to install and use our galaxy42 network for Ubuntu(tested on 16.04 LTS).
1) Install Sodium and Boost:
	sudo apt install libsodium-dev
	sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
2) Clone project from git-repository, enter project directory and change branch to usable_proxy_nocrypto:
	git clone https://github.com/tigusoft-vm/antinet
	cd antinet
	git checkout usable_proxy_nocrypto
3) Initialize and update submodules:
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
4) Change directory to galaxy42:
	cd galaxy42
5) Make project, you can do it for 2 different ways:

	5.1)First is not very secure so we recomend to use it only for Virtual Machines:
		sudo cmake . && make
	Using this method requied running script as a root.

	5.2)Second way is to install script called "install" which is placed in galaxy42/script/install-as-root and install it as a root:
		cd script/install-as-root
		sudo ./install
	Then go back to galaxy42, run cmake and make
		cd ../..
		cmake . && make
	This is safe method but can contain bugs.
