@brief Manager for objects that will use ioservice, provides them with a pool of ioservice objects;
References to #m_ioservice_array (and all it's elemets) remain valid as long as entire object of this class.
To avoid reallocations, the statically allocated array has compilation-time size #capacity()
While the run-time actuall number of running io_service is read by #size() and increased by #resize_to_at_least()

@thread thread_safe_public_myself

@warning For class developers:
all resizing must be done in one place, in #resize_to_at_least() !
#m_ioservice_array - has static capacity and is "resized" by us by #m_size
#m_ioservice_idle_works + #m_ioservice_threads - is resized by us

@warning All public operations must happen under mutex - #m_mutex
